# Data splits
The data splits only contain ids for the English gold data.
The splits are based on: https://github.com/RikVN/DRS_parsing/tree/master/data/pmb-4.0.0/gold.

Note that not all docs are usable due to the data issues mentioned in the main README, so the actual counts are slightly lower.

| Split   | # Docs   |
|---------|----------|
| train   | 7668     |
| test    | 1048     |
| dev     | 1169     |
| eval    |  830     |
